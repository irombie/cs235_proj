This is the project I did for data mining class. The goal is to classify songs according to their genre.
The classifier used is a convolutional neural network implemented using Keras. I got 70% test accuracy, which was almost 7 times 
better than the baseline methods implemented, decision trees and KNN. Due to the shortage of data, I got some overfitting issues, 
which I tried to overcome by early stopping and keeping the model not-so-complicated. The future work is to scale this project 
to work on a bigger dataset and get better results with an architecture that can understand and generalize the data in a better 
way.
